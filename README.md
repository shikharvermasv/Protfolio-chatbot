# 🧑‍💻 Personal Assistant (RAG-based Portfolio Chatbot)

This is my first **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** project, where I built a **personal assistant chatbot** that acts like my **portfolio**.  
It can answer questions about me, my work, and my experience in an interactive way.

## ✨ Features
- 💬 **Chatbot Interface** – Ask about my skills, projects, and background.  
- 🔎 **Context-Aware Responses** – Answers are grounded in my actual data.  
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** – Runs locally with Python.  
- 🤖 **Extensible** – Can be improved by adding more documents or connecting APIs.

- **LangChain** – for RAG and LLM orchestration  
- **OpenAI API and gemini API and many others**
